> Watch YouTube videos on your Mac via CLI

With pipcorn you can spawn a picture-in-picture YouTube player without installing anything!
Simple type the following into the terminal:

```
npx pipcorn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_B4LTHi3I
```

![Demo](https://github.com/JonnyBurger/pipcorn/blob/master/pipcorn.gif?raw=true)

It uses [ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core) and [open-pip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-pip) under the hood. However they are webpacked so that the program installs fast.

You can control the video via the Touch Bar of your MacBook.
